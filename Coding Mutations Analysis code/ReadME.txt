These files include the MATLAB codes that have been used to generate the results in the main manuscript.

The codes work in the following order:

1. PCAWG data analysis: includes two steps - preparing the data and then analyzing it
2. Germline data analysis
3. Finding the spectra and correlating to find patterns
4. Computing bias reversal measures for different spectra

Each one of these steps has its own corresponding folder here with a separate ReadME.txt file explaining the exact order of the MATLAB codes to be run and what MATLAB data files they generate.

The data we used is all in the folder named "Data_used_files", and the data files we extract to use later are found in the folder "Data_Extracted_files".
