Supplementary Tables and data for the project: ``Non-hypermutator Cancers Access Driver Mutations Through Reversals in Germline Mutational Bias''

Tables S1 to S4 provide data shown in figures 1 to 4 in the main text, respectively. Table S5 provides the 3-mer spectra plotted in figures S9 and S10.

UPDATE (March 2025): We have downsampled the skin and colon HM mutations in the positive selection detection analysis to avoid dominance of these two tissues in the HM dataset. Figure 4 in the manuscript and the Supplementary Table 4 have been updated accordingly.

The MATLAB code files used in analyzing the coding mutations are uploaded with data files in the folder "Coding Mutations Analysis Code"


Functional annotations per coding site using SnpEff are available in file "coding_sites_annotations_effects_3mers.txt.tar.gz".

If the file is empty, install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) then run `git lfs fetch`
